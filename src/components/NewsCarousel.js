    info:"The tides have shifted, and the winds of change have carried Storm from the depths of irrelevance to the peak of dominance in Marvel Rivals. Once an underwhelming pick, Ororo Munroe has become a force to be reckoned with, thanks to significant buffs introduced between Season 0 and Season 1.5. \n Back in Season 0, Storm struggled to make an impact on the battlefield. With a pick rate of just 1.66%, she was the least chosen hero in the entire game. Her win rate of 49.01% reflected her strugglesâ€”falling just short of the break-even point and proving that her kit lacked the effectiveness needed to compete with the gameâ€™s meta. Players simply werenâ€™t finding enough value in her abilities compared to stronger alternatives. \n Fast forward to Season 1.5, and the Storm we once knew is barely recognizable. With a pick rate now soaring to 5.49%, she is quickly becoming a favorite choice among players. More impressively, her win rate has skyrocketed to 57.48%, making her the most successful hero in the game right now. \n What changed? Several key buffs have made her a high-priority pick:\nðŸ”¹ Lightning Strike Damage Increase â€“ Stormâ€™s primary attack now deals significantly more damage, making her a deadly ranged threat.\nðŸ”¹ Wind Gust Mobility Buff â€“ Improved movement speed allows her to reposition quickly and avoid enemy pressure.\nðŸ”¹ Ultimate Rework â€“ Her iconic Tempest ability now has a shorter cooldown and a wider area of effect, making it a game-changing tool in fights.\n With these buffs, Storm is no longer just a flashy pickâ€”sheâ€™s a game-winning force. Teams are now incorporating her into their strategies, and high-level players are taking full advantage of her improved utility. Sheâ€™s become an essential part of team compositions that require burst damage, mobility, and crowd control.\n Stormâ€™s transformation is a testament to how balance changes can redefine a heroâ€™s role in Marvel Rivals. From being the least-picked character to sitting at the top with the highest win rate, she truly embodies the title.",
