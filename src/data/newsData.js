      description: "More info about the new character Blade leak and his abilities.",
      info:"Marvel Rivalsâ€™ latest Season 1.5 update has brought a lot of exciting new content, including new Heroes, Maps, and a teaser that fans have been waiting for, Blade. He makes an appearance in the new Empire Of Eternal Night: Central Park New York City map, serving as a hint that he will be coming soon. So, how will Blade fit into Marvel Rivals? In this piece, I will predict how he will impact gameplay based on leaks and lore.\n\n Blade Leaked Kit and Abilities \n\n Based on leaks, Blade will wield two different weapons. His primary weapon is a katana, which is obviously a melee weapon, likely capable of dealing high burst damage. His secondary weapon is a shotgun, providing some flexibility to handle threats at medium range. Now, letâ€™s take a look at his leaked skills before diving deeper into the analysis.\n Passive: Bloodline Liberation\n One of the most interesting aspects of Bladeâ€™s kit is his passive ability: Bloodline Liberation. Similar to The Punisher, it allows him to see enemies through walls. However, there is still no confirmation on how this ability is triggered. Will it require Blade to deal damage first, or is there another condition? If it works similarly to The Punisher, it could give him a strong edge in tracking and ambushing enemies, making him even deadlier while chasing enemies.\n Stomp and Slash \n Based on the leaks, Stomp and Slash will be Bladeâ€™s main attacking skill, allowing him to deal high burst damage with his katana. This would be his bread and butter, as its burst damage potential makes it perfect for catching enemies off guard and quickly eliminating them. \n The Dark Knight Attack \n Now, whatâ€™s the use of a burst melee combo skill if you canâ€™t get close to your enemies? This is where The Dark Knight Attack comes in handy. According to leaks, this ability is a dash strike that allows Blade to either close the gap or retreat when needed. However, itâ€™s still unclear whether this skill deals damage to enemies or simply serves as a movement tool. From the looks of it, it seems similar to abilities seen in characters like Psylocke, enabling quick repositioning or chasing down fleeing enemies with ease. \n Fang Deflect \n Fang Deflect is rumored to be Bladeâ€™s defensive skill, allowing him to deflect incoming ranged attacks. In the comics, Blade possesses superhuman senses and speed, so it makes sense that he could use his katana to parry incoming projectiles. It will likely function similarly to Iron Fistâ€™s RMB or Hawkeyeâ€™s melee deflect, providing a way to counter ranged opponents and maintain his aggressive playstyle. \n Ultimate Ability: New Moon \n Bladeâ€™s ultimate, New Moon, is rumored to transform him into his full vampire form. Surely, this transformation isnâ€™t just for showâ€”it enhances all his stats and grants access to an entirely new set of abilities. While the specifics of these abilities remain unknown, this ultimate could be what makes Blade truly terrifying on the battlefield. This would be the perfect opportunity to introduce lifesteal mechanics to the game. It would make sense if his vampiric form had a passive lifesteal ability, allowing him to heal whenever he lands a hit during his ultimate. This would further solidify Blade as a relentless Duelist, capable of sustaining himself in extended fights.",

      description: "More info about the new character Ciclops leak and his abilities.",
      info:"Cyclops is one of the heroes that comic fans are eagerly anticipating in Marvel Rivals. Various leaks suggest and confirm that he will indeed be added in a future update, bringing excitement to fans. In this piece, I will predict how he will fit into the game based on the leaks and lore. \n\n Cyclops Abilities Leak\n\n Lasers! As one of the most iconic heroes in Marvel, Cyclops will obviously use his optic blasts as the core of his kit in Marvel Rivals. While there is no official confirmation of his abilities yet, fans on Reddit have speculated about his potential skill set. I personally agree with the speculation.\n Here are the predicted abilities that Cyclops may bring to Marvel Rivals:\n - Snapshot Blast (Primary Fire) â€“ A quick-focus beam of optic energy that deals high damage but requires precise aim.\n - Optic Stream (Alt Fire) â€“ A continuous beam of optic energy, dealing constant damage while allowing Cyclops to move.\n - Wide-Angle Blast (Ability 1) â€“ Covers a wide area with an optic blast, dealing damage and knockback.\n - Ricochet Blast (Ability 2) â€“ Optic blast bounces off walls and enemies to deal additional damage.\n - Optic Recoil (Movement Ability) â€“ Allows Cyclops to propel himself away from the direction heâ€™s looking at when using an optic blast, giving him a mobility option.\n - Visor Off (Ultimate) â€“ Cyclops removes his visors to continuously channel a massive optic blast. He will be stationary but able to turn in any direction\n These abilities will be as perfect as they get and as lore-accurate as possible. With this potential kit, he could be a grounded Iron Man, as he is also a hero capable of channeling a deadly laser beam.\n Ricochet Blast would be his skill for finishing off low-HP enemies while also creating opportunities to damage others in the laser's bounce area. This skill was also featured in the late-game Marvel Heroes, proving to be highly effective.\n What would be really exciting if this leak turns out to be true is his ultimate, Visor Off. This could be devastating for enemies while also providing a theatrical and satisfying moment for teammates.",

With his leaked model and abilities surfacing online, itâ€™s clear that he will introduce new mechanics to the game. So, how will Ultronâ€™s presence impact gameplay in Marvel Rivals? In this piece, I will predict how he will fit into the game based on the leaks.\n\nUltron Leaked Kit and Abilities\n\nBased on recent leaks, Ultron is expected to be a Strategist hero, capable of both dealing damage and providing healing. His primary weapon, the Encephalo-Ray, is a powerful energy beam that inflicts burn damage on enemies.\nNow, letâ€™s take a look at his leaked skills before diving deeper into the analysis.\n\nPassive: Algorithm Correction\n\nHold Space to fall slowly while airborne.\nMany might expect Ultron to be a fully flight-based Strategist, which would be a new mechanic in the game. However, this passive suggests that he can fall, meaning he isnâ€™t a true flying hero like Iron Man or Storm.\n\nDynamic Flight (Shift)\n\n Quickly dashes in the direction of movement, then enters free-flight mode.\n While Ultron isnâ€™t a permanently flying hero, this skill confirms that he can enter free-flight mode, similar to Star-Lord.\n\n Imperative: Patch (E)\n\nCommands a giant drone to follow an ally, constantly healing allies within its radius, with additional healing for the designated ally. \nThis introduces a new healing mechanic, which could create opportunities for unique gameplay strategies.\n\nImperative: Firewall (RMB)\n\n Summons drones to grant bonus health to nearby allies, centered on Ultron and the ally marked with Imperative: Patch.\n Granting AoE bonus health to allies makes this ability a great tool for holding objectives, similar to Lokiâ€™s Regeneration Domain.\n\n Rage of Ultron (Ultimate) \n\n Summons Ultron Drones to fire Encephalo-Rays, which can damage enemies or heal allies.\n This hybrid ultimate serves both offensive and defensive purposes, making Ultron a powerful asset in the right strategy.",
